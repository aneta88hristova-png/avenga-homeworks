    <h1>Manganese (Mn) - Atomic Number 25</h1>
    <p>
      Manganese is a hard, brittle transition metal that is primarily used in
      steel production to improve hardness, stiffness, and strength. It is also
      an essential trace element for human health, playing a role in bone
      formation and metabolism.
