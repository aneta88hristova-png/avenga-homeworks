    <h1>Chromium (Cr) - Atomic Number 24</h1>
    <p>
      Chromium is a hard, lustrous, gray metal known for its high corrosion
      resistance and ability to take a high polish. It is widely used in
      stainless steel production, chrome plating, and as a pigment in dyes and
      paints. Chromium compounds are also important in tanning leather.
