    <h1>Neon (Ne) - Atomic Number 10</h1>
    <p>
      Neon is a noble gas that is colorless, odorless, and inert. It is best
      known for its use in neon signs, which emit a bright reddish-orange glow
      when an electric current passes through the gas. Neon is also used in
      high-voltage indicators and vacuum tubes.
