    <h1>Iron (Fe) - Atomic Number 26</h1>
    <p>
      Iron is a strong, durable transition metal that is widely used in
      construction and manufacturing due to its strength and abundance. It is a
      key component of steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon. Iron is also
      essential for human health, as it is a critical component of hemoglobin in
      red blood cells.
